## 📚 PBL – Problem-Based Learning Projects

Each folder represents a phase challenge (semester), focused on building a database and architecture for an e-commerce solution, integrating multiple disciplines.

| Phase | Focus Area | Summary |
|-------|------------|---------|
| F1 | Database Essentials | Relational modeling for product video management, views tracking, customer feedback, and business rule implementation with SQL constraints. |
| F2 | Start Data Management | SQL DML/DQL operations, customer/product data handling, Python ICMS calculator with JSON output, and ESG environmental plan proposal. |
| F3 | SQL Extension Language | PL/SQL anonymous block, service ticket analysis, LGPD compliance report, and query for categorized issue counts. |
| F4 | Programming & Infrastructure | PL/SQL procedure creation, Python-based SAC frequency histogram, Linux terminal practice, and basic infrastructure deployment. |
| F5 | NoSQL & Data Science | NoSQL PoC for performance improvement (graph, columnar, document DBs) and statistical analysis of sales data using Python (outliers, IQR, hypothesis testing, correlation). |
| F6 | Big Data Architecture | Design of a scalable Big Data pipeline using Lambda architecture to solve real business issues (e.g., cart abandonment), with data ingestion, distributed processing, and Power BI dashboards. |
